# YuriOS
Computerized assistant inspired by Yuri from DDLC.

<<<<<<< HEAD
YuriOS is a virtual desktop assistant capable of performing various functions as well as
providing limited user interactivity. It is designed to be able to carry out various tasks
consistent with other virtual assistants (e.g. Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana). Such
functions should include: weather, opening applications, changing system sliders such
as volume and brightness, as well as event scheduling and PDA features.

Another important aspect of the project is the ability to provide limited user
interactivity with the ability to change the mood state of the Yuri avatar. This can be
done with praise or non-orderly conversation.
